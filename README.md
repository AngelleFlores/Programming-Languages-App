# Programming-Languages-App

The Programming Languages App is an android app that is used to compare four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, LISP) on certain topics, such as concatenation, main program, and for loop.  A SQLite database is used to store and retrieve code of each language.  This app is useful to learn the differences between programming languages.  To view this app, use Android Studio.
